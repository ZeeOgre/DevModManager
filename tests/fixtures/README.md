# Test fixtures (committed)

This folder is for committed test documentation and (optionally) small synthetic test data that is safe to redistribute.

## Local-only fixtures
Real game/mod binaries should **not** be committed. Place them under:

- `tests/fixtures_local/tes/`

Examples (not provided in the repo):
- `tests/fixtures_local/tes/DebugMenuFramework.esm`
- `tests/fixtures_local/tes/DMF_ZEO.esm`
